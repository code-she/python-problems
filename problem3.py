#The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = int(input())
a<= 10^10 and a>=1
b = int(input())
b<= 10^10 and b>=1

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
